Test1:  Zendesk API client:   
	- The client file itself corresponds to zendesk.rb
	- I also wrote a test file at zendesk_test.rb for the client you can run to test it out

Test2: CSSCompressor class:
	- The class itself corresponds to compress.rb
	- A short test/use for the class, as given in the Test example, is at compress_test.rb

Test3: Grade class:
	- The class itself corresponds to grade.rb
	- Test/use of the class is at grade_test.rb

*Note these test files are't "proper" ruby tests, but useful to show you what cases I was thinking of/using to design the class
